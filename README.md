## üí° About

This repository is the result of a research project done for the course **Trustworthy Machine Learning** instructed and supervised by [Nicolas Papernot](https://www.papernot.fr/).

It explores how different strategies using [Sharded, Isolated, Sliced and Aggregated (SISA) unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03817) affect model fairness using the example of a facial age classifier and race as protected attribute.

I reimplemented SISA from scratch in PyTorch using a custom dataset, dataloader and model. Experiment tracking was done using wandb.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

The script `setup.sh` will prepare a newly created Google Cloud Virtual Machine (I used 32GB RAM and a single V100) to be able to run the experiments (download UTKFace dataset, install CUDA, clone repository, connect wandb, etc.). You will have to modify line `21`, `24` and `25` to include your GitHub username, email and access token. If you don't want to use GCP you can simply use the script as a step-by-step guide, leaving out the GCP-specific stuff like buckets.

Run a 5-fold cross-validated run with e.g.
```
python3 train.py --num_shards 5 --num_slices 3 --strategy random-balanced --put_in slice
```
meaning you are training a SISA model with 5 shards (3 slices each) using a sorted balanced sampling strategy that puts high-unlearning-likelihood samples in later slices.

Evaluate your run with
```
python3 evaluate.py --run_dir <your-run-name>
```
The results over all 5 folds will be written as a pickled summary to `summaries/`.
